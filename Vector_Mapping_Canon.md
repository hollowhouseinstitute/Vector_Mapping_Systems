# Vector Mapping Canon

Vector Mapping is the act of translating human-expressed material
(text, interaction, narrative) into multidimensional coordinates
that preserve relational structure without reducing human agency.

## Principles
1. Non-reductive
2. Consent-bound
3. Context-preserving
4. Reversible to narrative
5. Non-predictive by default

## Vector ≠ Person
Vectors represent **patterns**, not people.
Identity inference is prohibited.
