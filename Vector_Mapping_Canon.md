# Vector Mapping Canon  
## Hollow House Institute

This document defines the canonical principles, scope, and constraints of Vector Mapping Systems as governed by Hollow House Institute.

---

## Definition

Vector Mapping is a **human-delivered analytical methodology** for identifying, describing, and contextualizing relational, interactional, and symbolic patterns within human-generated material and human–AI systems.

Vectors represent:
- directionality
- relational positioning
- pattern movement over time

They do not represent individuals, diagnoses, predictions, or outcomes.

---

## Scope of Application

Vector Mapping may be applied to:
- human–AI interaction transcripts
- conversational systems
- relational datasets
- symbolic and narrative material
- system interaction logs
- documentation and audit artifacts

Applications are analytical and observational in nature.

---

## What Vector Mapping Is

Vector Mapping is:
- structured
- pattern-focused
- non-clinical
- non-diagnostic
- non-predictive
- governed

It is used to observe **how interactions move**, not to determine **what people are**.

---

## What Vector Mapping Is Not

Vector Mapping is not:
- therapy or counseling
- psychological assessment
- diagnosis or treatment
- behavioral prediction
- automated classification
- surveillance or profiling

No claims are made about individual mental states, intent, or future behavior.

---

## Ethical Constraints

All Vector Mapping activities must adhere to the following constraints:

- Human review and judgment are required
- Automation without authorization is prohibited
- Identity inference is prohibited
- Coercive or extractive use is prohibited
- Surveillance applications are prohibited
- Clinical or therapeutic framing is prohibited

---

## Governance Model

Vector Mapping Systems are governed under:
- Hollow House Institute licensing
- explicit use approvals
- non-commercial default terms
- auditability and review requirements

Unauthorized use voids any implied permission.

---

## Deliverables (When Licensed)

Licensed Vector Mapping work may produce:
- analytical reports
- pattern summaries
- relational trajectory observations
- governance and ethics commentary

These deliverables are analytical artifacts, not determinations.

---

## Relationship to Services

Vector Mapping Systems described here underpin:
- Hollow House Institute Vector Mapping Services
- Ethical AI and relational audits
- Dataset interpretation and annotation work

This document does not authorize independent commercial application.

---

## Canon Status

This document serves as the **canonical reference** for Vector Mapping Systems under Hollow House Institute.

Any derivative or applied use must remain consistent with this canon and be explicitly licensed.
