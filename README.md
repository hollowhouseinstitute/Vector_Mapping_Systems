# Vector Mapping Systems

Vector Mapping Systems defines how human relational, somatic, and symbolic data
is transformed into structured vector representations without extraction,
surveillance, or behavioral manipulation.

This repository does NOT collect data.
It does NOT train models.
It defines *how meaning is mapped* — not exploited.
