# Vector Mapping Systems  
### Governed by Hollow House Institute

Canonical vector mapping standards for relational, somatic, and symbolic pattern analysis.

This repository defines **non-software analytical systems** for mapping, describing, and reviewing relational and interactional patterns in human-generated material and human–AI systems.

All materials are governed by Hollow House Institute.

---

## Purpose

Vector Mapping Systems provide structured, ethical methodologies for identifying patterns, trajectories, and relational dynamics without prediction, diagnosis, or automation.

These systems are designed for:
- research and documentation
- ethical AI governance
- relational pattern analysis
- institutional audits and review
- licensed analytical services

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **standards and canon library**
- A **governed analytical methodology**
- A **licensable intellectual framework**
- A reference for **human-delivered vector mapping services**

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

This repository does **not** provide:
- software or executable tools
- automation or model deployment
- machine learning systems
- therapy, counseling, or diagnosis
- behavioral prediction or risk scoring
- surveillance or profiling systems

No clinical, medical, psychological, or predictive claims are made.

---

## Core Concepts

Vector Mapping, as defined here, refers to:
- directional pattern representation
- relational field analysis
- interactional trajectory observation
- symbolic and contextual patterning

Vectors describe **relationships and movement**, not people.

---

## Governance & Ethics

All methodologies are governed under Hollow House Institute ethical and licensing frameworks.

Key principles include:
- non-commercial by default
- human judgment over automation
- pattern analysis over identity inference
- governance over scale
- explicit prohibition of coercive, extractive, or surveillance use

---

## Licensing

Use of these materials is **non-commercial by default**.

Commercial, institutional, or applied use — including use in products, services, internal systems, audits, or AI development — requires explicit written authorization and licensing from Hollow House Institute.

Repository access does not grant applied rights.

---

## Relationship to Hollow House Institute

This repository supports:
